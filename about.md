## About Me

My name is Ryan Heywood. I'm a software developer with an interest towards
security and cryptography. I've contributed to projects in the past, such as
[Hashbang][hashbang] ([GitHub][hashbang-github]) and [ALE]. I've also built pet
projects in [Flask] and I'm currently learning Rust through writing a blog in
[Axum].

## Some of my Favorite Projects

### [Shell Server]

A lot of the work I contributed to Hashbang has been through the shell server,
a system designed to integrate with an external authentication database, built
resilient enough that we can trust that giving users the ability to run code on
our hardware wouldn't cause a significant impact on other users. The project is
an overall success, having spent years in a production status with hundreds of
users and minimal compromise, and has given me an incredible knowledge of how
Linux systems and what goes into making containers work.

### [FusionScript]

This was an experiment to see how powerful the Lua language could act as a VM
for a language with higher level constructs, like first class generators and
async operations. While the project as a whole is mostly abandoned, I learned a
lot while writing it and generally consider my time spent working on the
project to be incredibly valuable.
